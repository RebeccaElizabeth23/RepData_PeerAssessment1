# Loading and preprocessing the data  
1.Here we want to first load the data set  

```{r load data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

setwd('/Users/rek514/Documents/Data_science/Git_hub/RepData_PeerAssessment1')

# Load in packages needed for later
library(dplyr)
library(lattice)

# Stops numbers being shown in Scientific notation and set decimal places to 3
options(scipen=99999, digits=3)

# Load dataset into R
dataset <- read.csv('activity.csv')
# Convert the date column into a date data class
dataset$date <- as.Date(as.character(dataset$date, format = '%Y/%m/%d'))
```

# What is the mean total number of steps taken per day?

1. First we need to find the total number of steps per day
```{r mean steps}
# Group the data by date
date_grouped <- group_by(dataset, date)
# Calculate the total sum of steps for each day
step_total <- summarise(date_grouped,Steps=sum(steps, na.rm = TRUE))
```

2. Next we want to generate a histogram of these step totals.
``` {r histogram}
# Create a histogram with the total step data
hist(step_total$Steps,breaks=15, col='magenta', main = 'Total Daily Steps',
     xlab='Total Steps', ylab ='Frequency')
```

3. Finally we want to find the mean and median number of daily steps
```{r mean}
# Calculate the mean and median for the daily step total
stepmean <- mean(step_total$Steps)
stepmedian <- median(step_total$Steps)
```
The  **mean** daily step count is `r stepmean` and the **median** is `r stepmedian`.


# What is the average daily activity pattern?
1. First we want to plot the average number of steps taken across the whole day.

```{r time}
# Group the data by interval
interval_grouped <- group_by(dataset, interval)
# Calculate the total sum of steps for each interval during the day
intstep_total <- summarise(interval_grouped,Steps=mean(steps, na.rm = TRUE))
# Plot a line graph to show the step count across the day
plot(x=intstep_total$interval, y=intstep_total$Steps, type='l',
     main='Average step count across the day', xlab='Interval', ylab='Total Steps', lwd=2.5, col='blue')
```

2. Next we want to find out during which time point were the most steps taken?
```{r most activity}
intervalmax <- intstep_total$interval[which.max(intstep_total$Steps)]
```
In this individual, they made the most steps during the `r intervalmax`th interval.

# Imputing missing values

1. Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with 𝙽𝙰s)
``` {r missing values}
missingtotal <- sum(is.na(dataset$steps))
```
The total number of missing values is `r missingtotal`.

2. We now want to replace these missing values with the mean for that corresponding interval. These are saved in a new data set.
```{r replace na}
# Create a new data set
na_dataset <- dataset
# Loop through each of the data set entries
for (i in 1:(dim(na_dataset)[1])) {
  # Check if the steps value is NA
  if (is.na(na_dataset$steps[i])) {
    # Find the correct interval index value
    interval_index <- match(na_dataset$interval[i], intstep_total$interval)
    # Replace the NA with the interval mean value
    na_dataset$steps[i] <- intstep_total$Steps[interval_index] }
  else {}}
```

3. Finally we want to calculate the total mean and median number of steps per day  and plot the total daily step count in a histogram.

```{r recalculate}
# Group the data by date
date_grouped <- group_by(na_dataset, date)
# Calculate the total sum of steps for each day
na_step_total <- summarise(date_grouped,Steps=sum(steps, na.rm = TRUE))

# Calculate the mean and median for the daily step total
new_stepmean <- mean(na_step_total$Steps)
new_stepmedian <- median(na_step_total$Steps)

# Create a histogram with the total step data
hist(na_step_total$Steps,breaks=15, col='yellow', main = 'Total Daily Steps',
     xlab='Total Steps', ylab ='Frequency')
```

The new **mean** daily step count is `r new_stepmean` and the **median** is `r new_stepmedian`.  
This clearly shows that the presence of the missing values in the original data set has shifted the overall mean daily step count down by `r new_stepmean-stepmean` steps.   
Filling these missing values in has also meant the current data show a **normal distribution** (no skew) where the median and mean are the same. Previously, the missing values caused the data to show a **negative skew**.

# Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

1. Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels – “weekday” and “weekend” indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.

```{r weekend factor}
# Add a new empty column and name it 'Weekday'
na_dataset[,4] <- NA
colnames(na_dataset)[4] <- 'Weekday'

# Loop through each of the data set entries

for (i in 1:(dim(na_dataset)[1])) {
  # Check if the day is a saturday or sunday
  if ((weekdays(na_dataset$date[i]) == 'Saturday')|(weekdays(na_dataset$date[i]) == 'Sunday')){
    # If so, label as a weekend
    na_dataset$Weekday[i] <-  'Weekend'}
  # If not a weekend, label as a weekday
  else {na_dataset$Weekday[i] = 'Weekday'}}

#Convert to a factor variable
na_dataset$Weekday <- as.factor(na_dataset$Weekday)
head(na_dataset)
```

Above are the top 6 cases of the new data set with the additional **Weekday** variable.

2. We now want to see graphically whetehr the average steps at each interval period vary between weekend days and weekdays.

```{r panel plot}
# Group data by weekend variable and interval
weekday_grouped <- group_by(na_dataset, Weekday, interval)
# Daily step total for each weekday variable and interval
weekend_step_total <- summarise(weekday_grouped,Steps=mean(steps, na.rm = TRUE))

#Create a panel plot to show weekend and weekday data seperatly.
xyplot(weekend_step_total$Steps ~ weekend_step_total$interval | weekend_step_total$Weekday, type='l', layout=c(1,2), xlab = 'Time Interval', ylab = 'Total Step Count', lwd=2.5, col='red', main='Daily Step Count for the Weekend and Weekdays')

```
